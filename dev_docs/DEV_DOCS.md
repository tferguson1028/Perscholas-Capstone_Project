### Route Method Reminder:
- GET: Asking for something from server
- POST: Sending something to modify server state
- PUT: Sending something and requesting to modify data on server
- DELETE: Requesting to delete data on server 

Difference between POST and PUT. While they both can be implemented to do similar things,
- POST generally does not check for existing information. It is mainly for doing 1 simple function. (Create)
- PUT is generally for modifying existing data, so it is generally implemented to check for that data first. (Update)
